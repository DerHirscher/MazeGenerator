This is a simple program for creating customizable mazes that you can solve yourself or with the help of a solution algorithm. I decided to focus more on visualization than speed, so solving and creating large mazes may take a while. There are a few keys that allow you to toggle certain functions: 

* N: Creates a new maze
* R: Resets the path
* BACKSPACE: Deletes the last element of the path
* S: Solves the maze for you
* P: Lets you select the start and end points

You can solve the maze yourself by dragging the mouse along the path.
